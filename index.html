                    Hi, my name is Dylan Armstrong. I am currently enrolled in the UCF Coding Bootcamp and I am loving the challenge. I currently know how to write webpages in HTML and CSS. A couple fun facts about me are I love dogs, I was born in California and I love to travel.

                    I first began to have a love for dogs at an early age. From the time I was born I have lived with a dog so I think thats where my love for dogs comes from. I have had 8 dogs so far in my lifetime, 2 of which are still alive. I often offer to watch my friends dogs while they are out of town for the companionship and cause they are well behaved for the most part.

                    I was born in San Diego, California and then moved to Lancaster, California at an early age which is an hour above LA. I loved it there, especially the weather. 73 and breezy all day and down in the 50s at night. I moved to Florida about 12 years ago when my step dad was given a great job offer. Since then, especially in the past 4 years I have befriended the best group of friends I could ever ask for. We often travel together, go to music festivals and do group things such as friendsgiving and secret santa. Although I have my friends here, I still stay in touch with my friends from Kindergarden and visit them every so often.

                    My parents divorced at an early age so I would travel to see my dad in the bay area 3 times a year. After moving to Florida I would go see him over the summer. I think this is where my passion for traveling sprouted from. In the past 3 years I have gone to Chicago, Oregon, Miami, Michigan, Cancun and the Bahamas to name a few places. On my list for 2019 is Europe, New York City, Mexico City and Colombia.
